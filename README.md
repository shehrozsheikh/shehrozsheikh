# Hi, I’m Shehroz Ahmed 👋

**Senior Software Engineer | WordPress Expert | Python AI Developer | ReactJS & React Native | NodeJS | PHP | AI & DevOps Integrations**

---

I am a passionate and highly skilled Senior Software Engineer with over 10 years of professional experience across a broad range of technologies, including WordPress custom themes, plugins, and blocks, PHP, ReactJS, React Native, NodeJS, Python, Shopify, Automation BOTs, DevOps, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

In recent years, my focus has shifted towards AI and Machine Learning. I work extensively with Python on projects involving image detection using EfficientNet, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and vector search with Milvus. I deploy AI solutions using Flask, Docker, and Kubernetes, and integrate OpenAI models for advanced capabilities.

I am an avid learner who quickly adapts to new technologies and continuously expands my skill set beyond the core tools I use daily.

In addition to my professional work, I actively contribute to Stack Overflow and open-source communities like GitHub, WordPress Core, and WooCommerce. I am the creator of multiple free WordPress plugins and Chrome Extensions.

Known for my problem-solving skills and collaborative spirit, a senior colleague once said:  
> “He’s constantly digging into complex bugs no one else seems to be able to solve, always pitching in to help others when they’re stuck, and he’s got drive and initiative for days.”
